# README

The Rails-based application aiming to catch updates regarding recently discovered gems' vulnerabilities on https://rubysec.com/advisories.
The flow briefly: 
        - Check the website regularly in order to detect newly added vulnerabilities and save the retrieved updates to the database. 
        - On each fetch inform registered users by email and Slack.

### Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/abdsofia/vulnerability-checker.git
$ cd vulnerability-checker
```
### Install and configure system dependencies


In order to run the project, you'll need:

* ruby 2.6.1 
* Rails 6.0.0
* PostgreSQL
* Redis
* Sidekiq
* Action Mailer
* Bundler
* foreman

Run bundler to install gems:

```sh
$ bundle install
```

### Set up your local environment

```sh
$ cp .env.example .env
$ cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
# => Make sure to set PostgreSQL related environment variables in `.env`
```

### Database Setup


```sh
$ rails db:migrate && rails db:seed
```

### Run the app

Instead of running `sidekiq`, `redis-server` and `rails s`, Procfile-based simplification is used. To start the web app, simply run:

```sh
$ foreman start -f Procfile
```
